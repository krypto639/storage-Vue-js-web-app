# storage-Vue-js-web-app
During my studies at Ara I completed a course in Mobile and Web best practices for js frameworks where we moved through the development of software through uml class, state and use case diagrams, wireframing, test writting in Mocha, Jasmine and Jest and construction of the app with Model View Controller(MVC) and typescript compatibility before using in a js.framework. I selected vue.js as my framework and constructed the storage web app to be functional for managing an inventory of gear for a variety of different purposes. 

Future improvements to this project would be in responsive design, utilization of components and seperation of code to increase navigation and readability of code.
